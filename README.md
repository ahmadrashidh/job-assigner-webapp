# Job Distribution Program

## Overview
This Java WebApp facilitates distributing a number of jobs to a given number of workers, ensuring that all jobs are completed almost simultaneously. This project was developed during an internship at Full Creative Pvt. Ltd., and it has since been applied in a WebDriverIO Test Automation project to run different suites in parallel using GitHub Actions.

## Deployment
The Job Distribution Program can be deployed on any server or cloud platform. Make sure to configure the appropriate environment variables and database settings before deploying in a production environment.

## Acknowledgements
